# Cardiovascular-Sound-Classification-
This repository is for the Cardiovascular Sound Classification with MFCC Features and SVM

## Description:

In this project, I developed a robust and accurate system for classifying Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals into distinct cardiovascular categories using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. PCG signals, representing heart sounds, were classified into five categories: Aortic Stenosis (AS), Mitral Valve Prolapse (MP), Mitral Stenosis (MS), Mitral Regurgitation (MR), and Normal (NO).

## Key Achievements:

- Implemented k-fold cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the SVM classifier.
- Utilized pre-emphasis filters and envelope extraction for improved signal preprocessing.
- Created an interactive spectrogram display for a detailed examination of signal characteristics and overlaid MFCC features.
- Evaluated model performance using a confusion matrix, providing insights into accuracy, misclassifications, and other key metrics.


## Technologies Used:

- MATLAB for signal processing, feature extraction, and machine learning implementation.
- Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) for effective feature representation.
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) with the ECOC method for accurate multiclass classification.
